This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

## Installation of Angular
For windows, open up a terminal window and then run `npm install -g @angular/cli `
Set your permissions globally using `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in order to run the server.

It will take a few moments for the page to start so be patient.
